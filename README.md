# content_aggergator
A content Aggregator website using python flask


A content aggregator fetches information from various places online and gathers all of that information in one place. Therefore, you donâ€™t have to visit multiple sites to get the latest info: one website is enough.

With the content aggregator, all of the latest information can be gotten from one site that aggregates all the content. People can see the posts that interest them and can decide to find out more about them without traipsing all over the internet.

Python libraries used to build my content aggregator

Requests: HTTP library for Python, built for human beings.
Beautiful Soup: Python library for quick turnaround projects like screen-scraping.
PyMongo :is a Python distribution containing tools for working with MongoDB, and is the recommended way to work with MongoDB from Python.
SendGrid : for email sending
BluePrint : Functional Structuring of files
Concurent.futures: to achive faster execution time using multithreading.
